            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>We are in the Church, the holy Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of God, whom he hath conſecrated to himſelfe: Let vs count it a wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, <note place="margin">Motiues to godlines.</note> to prophane it with our impuritie: Chriſt, who hath reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciled vs to God, is a pattern ſet before vs, let vs expreſſe his example in the actions of our life: God doth ſhew himſelfe a father vnto vs: Surely we are too vnthankfull, if we ſhewe not our ſelues as children to him. Chriſt hath clenſed vs by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of his bloud, let vs ſhame to defile our ſelues with new ſtaines or filthines: He hath alſo inſerted vs into his myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call body, let not vs fall away from that bodie, by ſprinkeling our ſelues with foule blots. The holy Ghoſt hath dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated vs to God, as holy temples, let vs, by his helpe, who dwelleth in vs, <hi>make</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>our light ſo to ſhine before men, that they may ſee our good works, that our heauenly father may be glorified.</hi> We haue the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels our guides and watchmen, let vs not, by the filthie ſtinke of our ſinnes
<pb facs="tcp:178135:6"/> driue them from vs. Our ſoules and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are deſtined to heauenly glory and mortalitie: Let vs labour earneſtly to keep them pure and vndefiled, againſt the day of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>What is therefore for to be done by vs? I haue with a good meaning, for our mutuall edification in Chriſt, gathered like a Bee, and framed out of all the beſt Authors (this fire of Chriſtian Pietie and Charitie, that ſtirring vp one an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brotherly, and enflaming one an other in the way of a godly conuerſion, and holy conuerſation, we may attaine to the true felicitie of eternall life.</p>
            <p>Take ye this of me, your vnworthie Miniſter, with all fauourable counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: reade it with me, with a minde deſirous of Chriſtian holineſſe: Let it goe with me and you, all our life long: <note place="margin">

            <p>Well then ye reuerend men, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued brethren, let vs enter the way of true happineſſe: by a true conuerſion, and godly conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Let vs not faint in the way, for any difficultie or bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<pb facs="tcp:178135:7"/> of temptations, but let vs goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in a continuall ſtudie of continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and obedience, vnto righteouſnes, and by righteouſnes, vnto the glorie of eternall life.</p>
            <p>And afore all things, let vs do our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to learne to denie our ſelues: O how hard and difficult a matter is it, for a man to forget and forſake himſelfe, <note place="margin">A hard thing to forſake our ſelues.</note> and to apply his whole ſoule to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of God: How vnpleaſant a thing is it, for a worldly man, not to ſeeke his owne, but by doing all things according to Gods wil, to ſeek the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God. Let vs by denying our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, patiently beare the croſſe that God doth late vpon vs, that we may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to Chriſt, and by humilitie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our owne infirmitie, and begge the grace and helpe of God.</p>
            <p>When we haue thus forſaken our ſelues, let vs not neglect our neighbors, <note place="margin">From our ſelues, to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. From both to God.</note> but rather preuent them with honour, and in good earneſt imploy our ſelues wholely to procure their commoditie: From our ſelues and our neighbors, yea and from all things, let vs caſt our eyes vpon God, and reſigning our ſelues,
<pb facs="tcp:178135:7"/> and all that is ours, to his will, Let vs yeelde all the affections of our mindes to be ſubdued by him. If any thing fall out proſperouſly, let vs aſcribe it to God, &amp; not to our ſelues: If any thing ſucceed not according to our wiſh, let vs not be diſmayed with impatiencie: but if any euil happen vnto vs, let vs not therefore recken our ſelues vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, neither let vs complaine againſt God for our eſtate.</p>
            <p>Almightie God graunt, that by his holy ſpirit, working effectually in our hearts and minds, we may with carefull induſtry ſearch out the way of Truth and Charitie, &amp; with ardent deſire long to come to our heauenly Father: and hauing found out &amp; knowne the way, we may with good courage enter it, and with godly care walke in it: fleeing the vanitie and inconſtancie of the world, that we neither goe backward, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, either to the right hand, or to the left.</p>
            <p>The God of mercy and ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo frame the courſe of our liues, in the vſe of earthly things, that we pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per not our ſelues too much, <hi>but that we</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:178135:8"/> 
               <hi>vſe the world, as if we did not vſe it:</hi> That <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.</note> we may learne no leſſe to beare penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meekly, than abundance moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: That we may reſtraine Luxury, our deadly enemy, leaſt we turne the helps of our life into hinderances. Let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that theſe earthly things, are by the goodnes of God, appointed for our commoditie, that they might be as pledges, wherof we muſt one day yeeld an account.</p>
            <p>In all the actions of our life, let vs carefully looke vnto the ſpeciall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <note place="margin">To looke to our calling.</note> wherevnto God hath called vs, to do thoſe things which beſeeme it, and to ſhunne whatſoeuer is vnſeemely for it.

            <p>Theſe things, ye Reuerend men and brethren, I wiſh to you and my ſelfe, which my wiſhes and ſtudies, if I ſhall perceiue not altogether to bee vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vnto you, I ſhal ſeeme to haue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped ſufficient, and plentifull fruite for

And out of this delight, by cuſtome of ſinne, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred euill habits, which make our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to God hard: So that we get as the Prophet ſaith: <hi>A harlots forhead,</hi>
